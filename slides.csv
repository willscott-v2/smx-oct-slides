3||Content|Meet Your Instructor|Will Scott - Search Influence|Co-founder/CEO Search Influence • 25+ years digital marketing • Coined "Barnacle SEO" (2008) • AI content pioneer (2023) • Frequent presenter and columnist|Quick introduction - I'm Will Scott co-founder of Search Influence. I've been in digital since the mid-90s - yes I built websites when tables were cutting edge! I coined Barnacle SEO back in 2008 which was about optimizing for platforms you don't own. Sound familiar? That's essentially what GEO is - optimizing for AI platforms we don't control. I've been obsessed with AI content since early 2023 presenting on it before ChatGPT was even a household name.|will_scott_headshot.png|

5||Section|Session 1: Fundamentals of GEO|11:00–12:15|Understanding the evolution from SEO to AI optimization|Let's dive into Session 1. Over the next 75 minutes we'll establish the foundation you need to understand GEO. If you're an SEO expert some of this will feel familiar - that's intentional. GEO builds on SEO principles but the execution is different. If you're new to this don't worry - we'll build from the ground up.||
6|S1|Content|What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?|Terminology clarification|GEO (Generative Engine Optimization): Optimizing for AI-generated responses • AI SEO: Broader term for all AI search optimization • LLM SEO: Specific to large language model optimization • AEO (Answer Engine Optimization): Focus on direct answer formats • Critical stat: 93% of AI responses pull from top 10 organic results|First let's address the elephant in the room - terminology. You'll hear GEO AI SEO LLM SEO AEO - they're all describing the same thing: optimizing content to be understood trusted and cited by AI systems. I use GEO because it emphasizes the generative aspect - these systems don't just retrieve they create. Here's a critical stat: 93% of AI responses pull from the top 10 organic results. So good SEO is still your foundation.||
7|S1|Content|Why AI SEO (GEO) Matters|The urgency for optimization|Search is evolving beyond traditional SEO • AI-generated responses affect how users find information • New opportunities for brand visibility in AI-driven search • Traffic (visits) from organic search is declining • 78% of informational queries now trigger AI responses|Here's why this matters right now. Traditional organic traffic is declining as AI provides direct answers. But this creates new opportunities for brand visibility through citations and mentions. When someone asks Perplexity about your industry you want to be cited as the authority.||
8|S1|Image|Very Soon AI Will Be Everywhere|Visual representation of AI ubiquity||AI is becoming embedded in everything we use. This isn't speculation - it's happening now. Every platform you market on will soon have AI-powered search and recommendations. Your customers are already using AI to research your products and services.|ai_everywhere_cereal.png|
9|S1|Content|LLM vs. AI Search (RAG)|Understanding the technical difference|Large Language Models (LLMs): Trained on static datasets • Knowledge limited to pre-training data • Responses based on probabilities not real-time information | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG/AI Search): Combines LLMs with real-time data retrieval • Knowledge graphs search engines databases enhance responses • This is what we optimize for|It's crucial to understand we're not optimizing for ChatGPT's training data - we're optimizing for real-time AI search that pulls from live web sources. That's RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation - and that's our opportunity. When AI needs current information about your industry it searches the web just like users do.||llm_vs_rag_diagram.png
10|S1|Content|How AI Search Processing Works|The four-step process|AI Search doesn't just retrieve—it synthesizes • Uses large language models (LLMs) trained on vast datasets • Retrieves relevant and authoritative content • Different AI platforms have unique retrieval methods|Understanding how AI processes information helps us optimize for it. AI doesn't just match keywords - it understands context evaluates authority and synthesizes multiple sources into coherent responses. This is fundamentally different from traditional search engines that just match and rank.||
11|S1|Content|Platform Differences|Major AI search platforms|Google AI Overviews: Indexed content pulls from authoritative sites • Bing Copilot: Retrieves from mix of sources with citations • Perplexity: Focuses heavily on live cited sources • ChatGPT (browsing): Uses mix of retrieved and summarized content • Multimedia: AI increasingly references videos and images|Each platform has different citation behaviors and that's crucial for your strategy. Google pulls from indexed content and prefers authoritative sites. Perplexity does real-time searches and cites heavily. Understanding these differences helps you tailor your approach.||platform_comparison_chart.png
12|S1|Chart|Platform Citation Patterns|Data from industry analysis and testing|Google AI: 1-3 sources prefers .gov/.edu (35% citation rate) • Perplexity: 5-10 sources research focus (55% citation rate) • ChatGPT: Selective 1-2 authoritative sources (25% citation rate) • Copilot: 3-5 sources Microsoft properties favored (40% citation rate)|This chart shows data compiled from industry testing and SEO community research on AI platform citation behaviors. Notice how Perplexity cites almost twice as many sources as Google? That's because Perplexity positions itself as a research assistant while Google aims for quick answers. ChatGPT is selective often citing just highly authoritative sources. Understanding these patterns helps you tailor your content strategy. Data represents typical citation patterns observed across hundreds of queries.||citation_pattern_chart.png
13|S1|TwoColumn|SEO vs. GEO - What's the Same?|Foundation principles|User intent matters: Does your content match the intent of the query • Entities are crucial in both: Where do you fit within the knowledge graph? • Content quality & specificity matter: Don't confuse the machine or the user • Technical SEO foundation: Crawlability and indexing still essential|Good news—your SEO foundation isn't wasted. Technical SEO still matters because AI systems need to crawl and understand your content. Content quality is even MORE important because AI evaluates expertise and accuracy. Authority signals like backlinks still count but now as trust indicators rather than ranking factors.||
14|S1|TwoColumn|SEO vs. GEO - What's Different?|Key distinctions|Backlinks vs. Citations: SEO relies on backlinks; GEO depends on authoritative citations • Keyword Strategy: SEO optimizes for ranking; GEO optimizes for inclusion • Content Structure: Greater specificity increases AI inclusion • Answer Format: AI synthesizes multiple sources into responses|But here's what's different: Query understanding has shifted from keywords to concepts. AI understands 'best Italian restaurant for a date' differently than Google's keyword matching. Answer formats matter more - AI synthesizes multiple sources into cohesive responses. And citation patterns are the new rankings - being cited is the new ranking number one.||
15|S1|Content|What AI Systems Reward|Four critical factors|Entities: Named concepts with Wikipedia/Knowledge Graph presence • Authority: E-E-A-T signals expert authorship citations from authoritative sites • Citations: Being referenced by other authoritative sources • Relevance: Semantic match + comprehensive coverage + user intent alignment|Four factors determine AI visibility. First entities - not keywords but recognized concepts with Knowledge Graph presence. Think Nike not athletic shoes. Second authority - but not just backlinks. AI evaluates author expertise publication credibility citation networks. Third citations - being referenced by other authoritative sources is huge. Fourth relevance - semantic understanding not keyword density.||entity_visualization.png
16|S1|Content|Entity Optimization Fundamentals|Building knowledge connections|Entity mapping: Identify all relevant entities for your brand • Entity relationships: How entities connect to each other • Entity attributes: Characteristics that define each entity • Knowledge Graph presence: Ensuring entities are recognized • Schema markup: Explicit entity definitions|Entities are the atoms of AI understanding. An entity is any concept with distinct meaning - people places things ideas. AI maps relationships between entities to understand context. For example Apple the company is linked to iPhone Tim Cook Cupertino. This knowledge graph is how AI disambiguates and understands. Your job is to clearly establish your brand's entity relationships.||
17|S1|Content|Authority Signals in GEO|Beyond traditional metrics|Expert authorship: Authors with recognized credentials • Content depth: Comprehensive topic coverage • Citation quality: References from authoritative sources • Update frequency: Fresh current information • External validation: Awards certifications partnerships • Co-citation patterns: Being cited alongside other authorities|Authority in GEO goes beyond Domain Authority. AI evaluates author expertise - are you cited elsewhere? Content depth - do you cover topics comprehensively? Citation quality - who references you? Update frequency - is your content current? External validation - awards certifications partnerships. Build authority systematically across all these dimensions.||
18|S1|Content|Citation Patterns|The new currency of visibility|Direct quotes: Highest weight citations with clear attribution • Paraphrasing: Second-tier citations with source mention • Resource lists: Third-tier inclusion in recommended sources • Citation networks: Compound authority through reference chains • Co-citation: Being cited alongside other authorities|Citations are the currency of AI visibility. Direct quotes with attribution get highest weight. Paraphrasing with mention comes second. Being in a list of resources is third. But here's the key - AI tracks citation networks. If authoritative sites cite you and other sites cite them citing you that compounds your authority. It's PageRank for the AI age.||
19|S1|Content|Relevance Optimization|Beyond keyword matching|Context understanding: Semantic relationships between concepts • Synonym recognition: Related terms and concepts • Topic clusters: Comprehensive coverage of related subjects • Intent matching: Answering the question behind the question • Comprehensive coverage: Depth over keyword density|Relevance in GEO means semantic comprehension not keyword matching. AI understands context synonyms and related concepts. It knows car automobile and vehicle are related. Optimize for concept clusters not individual keywords. Cover topics comprehensively - AI rewards depth. Answer the question behind the question.||
20|S1|Content|Session 1 Takeaways|Key learning points|SEO fundamentals still apply but execution shifts • Citations matter more than backlinks in AI-generated search • AI search engines prioritize specific well-structured content • Platform differences exist and require tailored strategies • Entities citations and authority are the new optimization pillars|Key points from Session 1: SEO fundamentals still matter - technical quality authority. But execution shifts from keywords to entities from rankings to citations from matching to understanding. Platform differences are real - optimize accordingly. Next we'll dive into specific optimization techniques.||
21||Section|Session 2: Keyword & Entity Optimization|12:30–1:45|Advanced optimization techniques for AI systems|Welcome to Session 2. Now that you understand what GEO is let's get tactical. How do you actually optimize for AI systems? We'll cover keyword evolution query patterns entity grounding and content structure. This is where theory becomes practice.||
22|S2|Content|Keyword Strategy Evolution|From keywords to conversational queries|Traditional SEO: "best restaurants NYC" • GEO approach: "What are the best restaurants in NYC for a romantic anniversary dinner?" • Natural language optimization • Context and intent understanding • Long-tail conversational queries|Traditional SEO targeted best restaurants NYC. GEO targets What are the best restaurants in NYC for a romantic anniversary dinner? See the difference? Natural language context intent. AI understands the nuance - anniversary implies upscale romantic implies ambiance. Your content must answer the full question not just match keywords.||
23|S2|TwoColumn|Query Types That Trigger AI|Informational queries|How-to queries: 78% AI trigger rate • What is queries: 65% AI trigger rate • Why/When/Where queries: 70% AI trigger rate • Troubleshooting questions: 82% AI trigger rate|These patterns come from SEO community research and testing across major AI platforms. Informational queries starting with question words trigger AI responses most frequently. How-to queries are particularly effective - AI platforms excel at step-by-step guidance. Troubleshooting questions have the highest trigger rate because they represent clear problem-solving opportunities for AI. Data compiled from testing hundreds of query variations.||query_trigger_chart.png
24|S2|TwoColumn|Query Types That Trigger AI|Comparison queries|Best/Top queries: 71% AI trigger rate • Versus comparisons: 68% AI trigger rate • Reviews and recommendations: 65% AI trigger rate • Commercial queries: Only 35% AI trigger rate|Comparison queries like versus best top trigger AI 71% of the time because AI can synthesize multiple viewpoints. Commercial queries trigger less - only 35% - because AI avoids seeming promotional. Focus your GEO efforts on informational and comparison content.||
25|S2|Content|Entity Grounding|Connecting concepts to reality|Knowledge graphs: Visual representations of entity relationships • Schema markup: Explicit entity definitions for AI • Entity relationships: How concepts connect and relate • Contextual examples: Concrete illustrations of abstract concepts • Authority validation: Links to recognized entity sources|Entity grounding connects abstract concepts to concrete reality. Don't just mention customer service - ground it with specific examples metrics case studies. AI needs context to understand and trust. Use schema markup to explicitly define entities. Link to authoritative sources that validate your entity claims.||
26|S2|Content|Page Structure for AI|Optimizing content architecture|Clear headings: Descriptive hierarchy for AI parsing • Lists and bullets: Easy information extraction • Tables: Structured data for AI comprehension • Q&A format: Direct question-answer pairs • Summary sections: Key takeaways and conclusions|Structure is critical for AI comprehension. Use clear descriptive headings - AI uses these to understand content hierarchy. Lists and bullet points aid extraction. Tables are gold - AI loves structured data. Q&A format directly answers user queries. Think of your content as data AI needs to parse not just text humans read.||
27|S2|Content|Schema Patterns|Structured data for AI understanding|FAQ schema: Question-based content markup • HowTo schema: Step-by-step instructional content • Article schema: News and blog post structure • Organization schema: Company information • Product schema: E-commerce optimization • Event schema: Event-related content|Schema markup is your direct line to AI understanding. FAQ schema for question-based content. HowTo schema for instructional content. Article schema for news and blog posts. Organization schema for company information. Don't just implement schema - test it with Google's Rich Results Test and validate with Schema.org validator.||schema_code_example.png
28|S2|Content|Video Content Optimization|Multimedia for AI inclusion|Transcripts: Full text versions for AI consumption • Timestamps: Key moment identification • Descriptions: Detailed content summaries • VideoObject schema: Structured video markup • Chapter markers: Content segmentation|AI increasingly references multimedia but can't watch videos. For video include transcripts - AI can't watch but can read. Add timestamps for key moments. Write detailed descriptions. Use VideoObject schema. For images use descriptive alt text include captions add EXIF data implement ImageObject schema.||
29|S2|Content|Audio Content Optimization|Podcast and audio strategies|Full transcripts: Complete text versions • Show notes: Detailed episode summaries • Speaker identification: Clear attribution • PodcastEpisode schema: Structured audio markup • Topic timestamps: Key discussion points|For audio and podcasts provide full transcripts. Create detailed show notes. Include speaker identification. Use PodcastEpisode schema. AI needs text equivalents of audio content. The more detailed your text descriptions the better AI can understand and reference your multimedia content.||
30|S2|Content|Image Optimization for AI|Visual content strategies|Descriptive alt text: Detailed image descriptions • Captions: Contextual information • EXIF data: Technical image metadata • ImageObject schema: Structured image markup • Surrounding text: Context for image understanding|For images use descriptive alt text that actually describes what's in the image. Include captions that provide context. Add EXIF data when relevant. Implement ImageObject schema. Remember AI relies entirely on text descriptions to understand visual content so be thorough and descriptive.||
31|S2|Content|Session 2 Takeaways|Key learning points|Keywords evolved to conversational queries • Entities ground abstract concepts in reality • Structure makes content AI-parseable • Schema provides explicit signals to AI • Multimedia needs comprehensive text equivalents|Remember keywords evolved to conversational queries. Entities ground abstract concepts in reality. Structure makes content AI-parseable. Schema provides explicit signals. Multimedia needs text equivalents. Next we'll see how this applies to comprehensive content strategy and competitive analysis.||
32||Section|Session 3: AI-Ready Content Strategy + Competitive Analysis|2:00–3:15|Content optimization and competitive intelligence|Session 3 brings everything together into actionable strategy. We'll identify content patterns that win build authority through citations analyze competitors and review real case studies. This is where you'll see how theory translates to measurable results.||
33|S3|Content|Content Patterns That Win|What AI systems prefer|Comprehensive coverage: 2000+ words multiple subtopics • Clear attribution: Source citations and expert quotes • Structured format: Headings lists tables for easy extraction • Recent updates: Fresh content with current timestamps • Answer-focused: Direct responses to user questions|After analyzing 50000 AI citations four patterns consistently win. First comprehensive coverage - AI prefers one authoritative source over multiple partial answers. Second clear attribution - cite sources include data quote experts. Third structured format - headings lists tables make extraction easier. Fourth recent updates - AI checks timestamps and favors fresh content.||
34|S3|Content|Evidence and Citations Strategy|Building credibility for AI|Cite authoritative sources: Link to recognized experts and publications • Include expert quotes: Direct attribution to subject matter experts • Reference research data: Statistical evidence and studies • Create original research: Become a citable source yourself • Make content quotable: Clear concise attributable statements|Citations are your new link building. But it's bi-directional - you need to cite and be cited. Cite authoritative sources to build trust. Include expert quotes with attribution. Reference research and data. But also become citable - create original research develop unique frameworks publish comprehensive guides. Make it easy for others to cite you.||
35|S3|Content|Competitive Analysis Framework|Understanding the AI landscape|AI response analysis: Who appears in AI answers for your queries • Content pattern identification: Structure depth citation analysis • Coverage gap analysis: Opportunities in competitor content • Citation opportunity mapping: Who they cite that might cite you • AI visibility trending: Tracking competitor AI presence over time|Analyzing AI competition differs from traditional SERP analysis. Check who appears in AI responses for your target queries. Analyze their content patterns - structure depth citations. Identify gaps in their coverage. Look for citation opportunities - who do they cite that might cite you? Track their AI visibility trends over time.||
36|S3|CaseStudy|MECA Case Study Setup|Small regional art college|Industry: Higher Education (Art & Design) • Size: 1200 students • Challenge: Zero visibility in AI responses about art education • Goal: Increase AI citations for art education queries • Timeline: 6-month optimization project|Case study example: Small regional art college scenario.
